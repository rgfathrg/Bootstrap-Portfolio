          <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 8px">“It is not the critic who counts...The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood..., because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”</p>

          Educated in criminology at West Virginia University I took my newly acquired
          skills to China to teach children how to speak the wonder language of English. From there 
          began a job carousel through gym membership sales, adminstrator at a self-defense gym, bank teller, and financial operations. My cure for the daily douldrums is travel, eating out, reading a riveting story,  
          taking in the fresh air of good ole nature, and of course having adventures with my family.

          I have been fortunate to have called several places home including Maryland, China, Washington D.C.,
          and North Carolina. Each place has brought awesome experiences and a generous quantity of amazing people. Currently 
          I reside in Charlotte, North Carolina while continuing to work in financial operations. Passionate about the powerful 
          tool money can be in supporting one's goals I have aspirations of building applications and games that encourage financial
          literacy and build financial independence.

          As a space enthusiast I am eagerly awaiting the day when we touch back down on the moon and finally reach Mars. 
          The impossible seems so small among the great expanse. Perhaps, one day I can touch the outer limits but for now I'll just
          keep looking up.
